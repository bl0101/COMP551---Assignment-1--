We couldn't fit all of our data into one big file as github had a file size limit that we exceeded even if the file was compressed.
We added a dialog tag at the beggning of the 1_reddit.xml corpus and one at the end of the 7_yahoo.xml corpus.
To make the file you only need to unzip all the zipped files and to concatenate them starting from 1_reddit.xml and finishing with 7_yahoo.xml
